require 'colorist'

# Output colours to ws2812 strips and other 800khz ws2811 led devices
# To use, simply set colours in the 'colors' array property as css color strings
# or Colorist::Color objects, then call #output(pin) to send it on it's way
# 
# Note that this requires firmware v1.2 and there is a maximum of 64 lights in the
# firmware at the time of writing. You can connect 64 leds to each of the digital
# pins on the LittleWire or Digispark device, and this enables you a total of
# 64 * 4 = 256 lights! Neato! Remember a USB port cannot supply enough current to
# power 256 lights at full brightness. Power usage is roughly (20ma * color_channel)
# per light. So 64 lights all lit full brightness white consumes 20*3*64 = 3.84 amps!
# Wow that's a lot of light for one little wire! And you can have four of those!

  # Set the pixel wiring style. The default :rgb is great for the little ws2812 LEDs

  # green, and blue outputs of the controller chip connect to different colours of LEDs!
  # 
  # Of particular note, the original Adafruit Florapixels (now called version 1) can be modified
  # to run at the 800khz speed instead of 400khz by breaking off this leg on the chip on the back:

  # wired bizarrely in RBG order. I rebuke thee, adafruit industries!! Also supposedly some
  # other version of the v1 florapixels used another different wiring and I don't think they're
  # labeled differently, so try it and see what works for you, or just give up and buy some
  # ws2812 strip from aliexpress - it's only like 30Â¢ per LED including shipping anyway!
